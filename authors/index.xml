      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a recent Masters graduate with multiple years of research experience and strong data analysis skills. I am currently looking for work where I can apply my skills from my data science and biology background. Within the UK I am primarily looking for work in the greater London and Cambridge areas. In the US, I am open to working in any big city but I am flexible if the right offer comes my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervised by Alex Dumbrell, my research primarily focused on the structuring dynamics of microbial communities and how the diversity of these communities is connected to ecosystem processes. Utilizing R, bash, and other bioinformatics tools, I applied a variety of statistical modeling, machine learning, and network analysis methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research, I was part of the Pint of Science team for his university where he helped run multiple scientific communication events for the Colchester area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and trying new food. I enjoy board games of all types and have been both a DM and a player in Dungeon and Dragons (5e) games.&lt;/p&gt;
